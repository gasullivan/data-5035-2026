Hi, Paul.  I'm uploading three files for my Final project proposal.  I'm going to be mostly offline for a few days, so wanted to get this submitted before that.  Two files are named 'G Sullivan 5035 Final Project Proposal.xxx'.  These are exactly the same, but one is a Word document and the other a PDF version of the Word doc.  I wasn't sure which one you might prefer.  The other file is what I would use for my 5-minute pitch if this proposal is chosen for presentation in class.  A note on that:  if my travels go as planned, I'll be in an airport during class.  I'll be comfortably settled in an area of the Admirals Club where I'll absolutely be able to present, if called upon.  I'm very much looking forward to hearing the other proposals as I know we have a bright and creative class.  PS - I used Copilot to auto-generate the pptx from the docx (creating effective PP slides is not in my current skill set).  I used Claude to generate some of the code I used to import and analyze the early data sets mentioned.  I could share that code, as well, if you'd like, but thought that would wait for the actual final project submission.  Finally, I've recently been working with Flourish for visualizations.  Are you familiar with it?  It's amazing, but I'm just beginning to learn it and included one, quick Flourish viz in the proposal (but not in the pitch).
