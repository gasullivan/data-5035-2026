It is only one thing: **trust**.  \nWhen data is accurate, well-governed, traceable, and well-documented, stakeholders can no longer question *how* an answer was produced. Clear lineage, consistent definitions, and reliable transformations shift conversations away from debating numbers and toward evaluating assumptions, impactful implications, and key decisions. In this sense, trust — not dashboards or models — is the true deliverable of high-quality data work.\n\n---\n\n## Key Insight 2: Why Leaders Rely on Intuition\n\nI've seen some incredibly bright leaders make very uninformed decisions. Why is this? One is idea goes back to trust. It is natural for people to \"trust\" their instincts above everything else. After all, it is what they know the best as it is learned from their own experiences (I'll share a great example of this in our class). Leaders often rely on intuition not because they disregard data, but sometimes also because they have learned that data systems can be inconsistent  or inaccurate. When data quality is uncertain, ownership is unclear, or results change unexpectedly, intuition feels safer than analytics. Strong data engineering addresses this by creating predictable, explainable, and resilient systems, allowing leaders to replace gut instinct with confidence in the data - yet, some seem never to be able to find a way to trust the data.\n\n---\n\n## Key Insight 3: How the Reis & Housley Framework Legitimizes Analysis\n\nThe *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* framework legitimizes analytical conclusions by emphasizing the full data lifecycle, architectural clarity, data provenance, and observability. Rather than treating analysis as an isolated activity, the framework positions it as the outcome of disciplined engineering practices. By making data systems transparent and reliable, the framework enables analyses that stakeholders trust, allowing data to confidently inform the “best answer” rather than merely a plausible one."
